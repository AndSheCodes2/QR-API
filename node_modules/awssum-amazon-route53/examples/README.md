# Examples #

To run these examples firstly copy the set-env.sh to your own file and fill in your details:

```

Then, source your env vars and run the example files.

DISCLAIMER: some examples may incur charges on your account. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW WHAT THE EXAMPLE FILE IS
DOING BEFORE YOU RUN IT. (Also note, I haven't made these example do anything too crazy, and mostly it's free
operations but you should still check what the example is supposed to do.)
